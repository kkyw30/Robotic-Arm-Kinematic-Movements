# Robotic-Arm-Potentiometer-Movements
This is the Arduino program I wrote to control the kinematics of a robotic arm. I calculated the optimal range of motion for each joint of the arm, and defined those ranges of motion in the program. My program controls the servo motors used in the robotic arm, and allows for remote control of the arm with a potentiometer.
