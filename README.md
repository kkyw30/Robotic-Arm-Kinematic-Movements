# Robotic-Arm-Kinematic-Movements
This repository contains the programs I wrote to control the kinematics of robotic arms. I calculated the optimal range of motion for each joint of the arm, and defined those ranges of motion in the program. My program controls the servo motors used in the robotic arm, and allows for remote control of the arm with a potentiometer. This repository contains both the initial MATLAB program used to calculate the kinematics, and the Arduino program used to control the servos on the robotic arms I built.
